## Description

*Sx Site Rating* gives you the ability to add one or more widgets to your site asking and presenting
a rating from the users. This rating is a single rating for your site, service, e-shop etc. If you need
more than that, for example a rating for your pages or posts please consider other options.

Each widget of Sx Site Rating can have its own separate settings so you can have one widget presenting
the rating and another in other location asking users to rate your site.

Settings for the widget include:
* Label editing
* Editing the color of stars (active and inactive state)
* Option to hide total votes
* Option to hide the result of ratings (number)
* Option to hide the stars presenting the rating
* Option to not allow voting from current widget instance
* Center or left align of widget

The plug in also adds an admin menu where you can view the ratings in detail and access general settings.

General Settings include:
* Disable voting for all widgets
* Keep or delete the rating after deactivation of the plugin
* Set the cookie expire time
* Reset ratings to 0 and delete all votes.
