A simple single rating plugin for your wordpress site

== Description ==

*Sx Site Rating* gives you the ability to add one or more widgets to your site asking and presenting
a rating from the users. This rating is a single rating for your site, service, e-shop etc. If you need
more than that, for example a rating for your pages or posts please consider other options.

Each widget of Sx Site Rating can have its own separate settings so you can have one widget presenting
the rating and another in other location asking users to rate your site.

Settings for the widget include:
* Label editing
* Editing the color of stars (active and inactive state)
* Option to hide total votes
* Option to hide the result of ratings (number)
* Option to hide the stars presenting the rating
* Option to not allow voting from current widget instance
* Center or left align of widget

The plug in also adds an admin menu where you can view the ratings in detail and access general settings.

General Settings include:
* Disable voting for all widgets
* Keep or delete the rating after deactivation of the plugin
* Set the cookie expire time
* Reset ratings to 0 and delete all votes.


This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
